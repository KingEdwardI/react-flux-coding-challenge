Flux Actions
------------

action creators are exported from app/actions/ into the component they will be used in.

the app dispatcher handles disptaching the action to the store. -- this is the equivalent of Redux reducers.

based on the type of the dispatched action, the store is manipulated accordingly in the AppStore.
